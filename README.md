# Flight Comparer

# About
This webapp is a dummy project, with the objective of challenging myself, testing and showcasing the skills learned during my time as a trainee.

The web aplication is similar to your average flight agregator website, such as momondo, or trip.com, as it takes the inputs from the user, and then displays the results based on those same inputs.

Using Java as the main programming language, and making use of springboot for the backend, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.

The webapp sometimes will not show results, this is due to the api's, as they sometimes dont give any results or have an internal error, depending on the input.

## How to use

Make sure you have a java ide installed, i recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), as the app was developed using it.

Download the webapp, by pressing the code button and selecting the zip. after the download is done, extract it, and open the extracted folder with intellij.
Keep your eyes out for the bottom right of intellij as it might show pop up for you to press to load a dependency.
Now after opening the project in intellij, and have loaded the dependencies, navigate to the folder that has the main class, as shown below

and run the SpringBootWebAppApplication (the java class thats highlighted in the image).
after the app is up and running, go to your browser and go to http://localhost:8080
and thats it.

Keep in mind that you dont need to restart the app as you use it, and you can just go to the main page to make another search.
