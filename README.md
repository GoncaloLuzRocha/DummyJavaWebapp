# Flight Comparer

# About
This webapp is a dummy project, with the objective of challenging myself, testing and showcasing the skills learned during my time as a trainee.

The web aplication is similar to your average flight agregator website, such as momondo, or trip.com, as it takes the inputs from the user, and then displays the results based on those same inputs.

Using Java as the main programming language, and making use of springboot for the backend, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.

## How to use

Make sure you have a java ide installed, i recommend IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows)
download the webapp, by pressing the code button and selecting the zip. after the download is done, extract it, and open the extracted folder with intellij.
Keep your eyes out for the bottom right of intellij as it might show pop up for you to press to load a dependency.
Now after opening the project in intellij, and have loaded the dependencies, navigate to the folder that has the main class, as shown below
